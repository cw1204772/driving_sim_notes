# Euro Truck Simulator 2

## Equipment

- [PC / Monitor](/pc.md)
- [Rig / Wheel / Bass Shaker](/rig_wheel.md)
- Xbox Controller

## Simhub Setting

Simbhub version: 9.8.2

### Effects profile
- Select "Euro Truck Simulator 2" when creating profile
- Set "impact" to 100% intensity to simulate crash
  - This seems to take the lateral g-force from the game. So both car crash and harsh stopping will trigger this effect.
- Set "road rumble" & "road impact" to 70% to feel the bumps/feedback from the road
  - This is triggered when hitting actual bumps / rumbles / grass.
- Set "road vibration" to 35% to feel the general vibration from the road.
  - This takes suspension telemetry data. Enabling this to provide a constant low-level vibration effect.
- Set "engine vibration" to 40% to mimic engine vibration.
  - Use this instead of RPMs because it feels more natural (correlate to engine sound).
- Set "gear shift" to 30% to mimic the gear shift.

### Sound output

- Use front/rear output.
- All road effects enabled only on the "front" output. Except for impact, I enable on both front and rear for the "impact" feel.
- All engine effects enabled only on the "rear" output
